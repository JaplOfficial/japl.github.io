			<h1>The Minimax Algorithm</h1>
			<p style="color:grey ; font-size:20px ; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">29 November 2020</p>

			<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color      : #A65E4E; font-size:30px;">Motivation</p>
			<p style="font-size:25px ;  text-align: justify"> I have been looking forward to getting to know a new algorithm
																												that has been intriguing me for quite some time . I am talking
																												about the Minimax algorithm and my main motivation to learn it
																												was the possibility to create a program that was capable of making
																												a smart decision in a turn-based game like tic-tac-toe , to see what kind
																												of strategies would the program develop to maximize the chances of winning .
																											  The use of AI algorithms to play such games dates back to the 1950s, when
																												Alan Turing alongside David Champernowne developed the Turochamp, a program
																												designed to play an entire game of chess against a human player. Unfortunately,
																												due to the complexity of the algorithm, Alan Turing was never able to run his
																												algorithm on a computer before his death, leaving an unfinished project that was
																												not continued. Later, several new proposals were made as alternatives to Turing's
																												original idea, amongst them Alex Bernstein's program , developed to work on the
																												IBM704 computer, which was very powerful for the time being. </p>

			<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color      : #A65E4E; font-size:30px;">What is Minimax</p>
			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">Minimax is a recursive backtracking algorithm normally used in
				 																							the development of AI agents capable of playing turn-based zero-sum
																											games (games in which one player's win is offset by the loss of another
																											player , for instance the victory of a player in tic-tac-toe implies the
																											loss of the other ) consisting of at least two players, such as tic-tac-toe,
																											chess, checkers,  connect four and others.</p>
			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">
																											The Minimax algorithm works in the following way . We have two types of players, the
																											maximizer which represents the AI and aims to maximize the chances of winning, and the
																											minimizer which represents the opponent and will do everything possible to minimize
																										  the AI's chances of winning , assuming that both players play optimally so that the AI
																											doesn’t miss any clever corner case that would lead to defeat . It is important to note
																											that these two types of players are hypothetical and the algorithm mimics them to simulate
																											what the next best move will be . The algorithm does this by foreseeing all possible game
																											states some number of moves away , picking the path which produces most favourable results
																											.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">( The following pseudocode shows the inner workings of the algorithm . ) </p>


			<img src="Images/pseudo_codigo.svg" width=100%>
			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">The function receives three arguments . The node that could represent a game state, the depth
				 																							that is used to track the number of moves made so far to reach the current game state (alternatively,
																											it could also represent the depth of the game tree, which we will see later along the way), and the
																											boolean variable "maximizing", which tells us whose turn it is, if it is true, then it is the maximizer's
																											turn. If it is the maximizer's turn, we keep the maximum possible score from the child layer of the
																											current game state, otherwise we keep the minimum possible score with the goal of simulating optimal decisions
																											from both players. We repeat this process until we reach a final state (the node is a leaf of the game tree).

			<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color      : #A65E4E; font-size:30px;">Game Tree</p>
			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">
				  The game tree, as it is commonly called in game theory,
				 	is a directed graph whose nodes represent game states.
					Game trees are of great importance in AI, as they allow us
					to search through all possible paths a game can take ,
					granting us the possibility to hand-pick the most advantageous scenarios .
					There are different types of game trees, among them we can find the complete
					game tree, which represents all possible ways of playing a game, and the
				  partial game tree, which creates the game tree only up to a certain specified
					depth . With a complete game tree, it is possible for the minimax algorithm to
					find the path that increases the chances of winning. Even though minimax looks
					like a neat algorithm, there is a colossal underlying issue attached to it.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">
				( The following image shows a section of a tic-tac-toe game tree in which the maximizer has two options .
				if it plays in the upper right corner, the game ends in a tie, if it plays in the lower right corner,
				the outcome will be a victory for the maximizer, therefore the optimal move is the latter . )

			<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color      : #A65E4E; font-size:30px;">Time Complexity</p>
			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">
				The complete game tree grants us the path to success by generating all possible games that can be played,
				however this can be extremely costly as the game becomes more convoluted. This problem is caused by the
				recursive nature of minimax, which produces an exponential time complexity, more precisely O(b^m), where "b"
				is the average branching factor and "m" is the average game length .
			</p>
			<img src="Images/Complexity_Table.svg" width=100%>
			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">
				As we can see from the image above, the calculation of the complete game tree might be feasible for games
				like tic-tic-toe (my implementation of minimax to solve tic-tac-toe can be found
				<a href="https://github.com/JaplOfficial/JaplOfficial.github.io/blob/main/Code/TicTacToe.cpp" target="_blank">here</a> )
				since it has about 255168 possible games, which can be calculated quite fast in modern computers,
				however it becomes impossible in other games like chess, which have about 10^120 possible games.
				A possible solution is to use a partial game tree instead of the complete game tree and compute a fixed
				number of moves in advance instead of computing all possible game states . Another alternative is to use some
				tree pruning algorithm such as alfa-beta pruning ( which I might write later in a separate blog post ) to cut
				unecessary recursion , which saves a lot of extra computation .

			<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color      : #A65E4E; font-size:30px;">The Utility</p>
			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">
				So far we have seen practically everything that is needed to implement a functional AI agent that is capable
				of making smart decisions using the Minimax algorithm. The final necessary step is to figure out how we can tell
				the algorithm which game states seem more favorable. If the current node in the game tree is a leaf, then we know
				that this game has reached a final state, so we return the corresponding utility .
				The question one might ask is
				what these utility functions are and how can they be defined. The utility is the rating given to the leaf nodes in the
				game tree, these are the ratings that define how good a particular game state really is. Let's see how this works
			  with a fairly simple example, the tic-tac-toe has three possible game results, a win, a loss or a tie. Since we want
				the AI to win, and the AI is looking for the maximum possible score, we need to associate the winning game states with
				a positive score for the algorithm to prioritize them, while the losing game states need to be associated with a negative
				score for the algorithm to avoid them, the tie game states can have a neutral value between the winning and the losing
				value . The following image shows a tic-tac-toe game tree , where the winning , losing , tie game states have the ratings
				of 1, -1, 0 respectively .
			</p>
			<img src="Images/heuristics_tree.svg" width=100%>

			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">
				As we can see from the labels, the orange layer represents the maximizer and the blue layer the minimizer. It is also
				important to note that the orange layer selects the maximum score from its children, while the blue layer selects the
				minimum score in an attempt to simulate optimality from both sides . Since the root of the tree was assigned a one we
				can prove that there is a sequence of moves that will grant the maximizer a certain victory .
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">
				We have seen how to define
				the utility funtion for tic-tac-toe , but how would utility work in a more complex game like chess ? One might say that chess
				also has three possible results , therefore implementing a similiar idea to the previous tic-tac-toe example would be a
				good idea , but that would throw us down the rabbit hole since this would imply being able to compute the game tree down
				to the leaf nodes , which would be hopeless given the mind-boggling number of leaf nodes in the complete chess game tree .
				A much more reasonable approach is to assign values to each piece so that the algorithm prioritizes the most valuable pieces .
				For example, if the king was threatened, the algorithm should do something immediately to avoid a possible loss, on the other
				hand if a pawn was threatened, it should not be of much importance .
			</p> <br> <br> <br> <br>


			<p style="font-size:25px ; text-align: justify">
				So there we go! This should be all we need to know to implement a functional AI
				agent using Minimax, but now it's your turn, so I'll leave the reader with a challenge.
				Try to implement a Minimax approach for the CodinGame <a href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">ultimate tic-tac-toe challenge</a>
				and optimize it to get a good score . See you in the leaderboard .
